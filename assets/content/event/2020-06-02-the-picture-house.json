  "description": "The Picture House with Come Together Collective is a moving image exhibition and screening event featuring an eclectic range of work from local artists. In the third DIY art and music event from the South Manchester-based collective you are all invited once more into our home for an interactive experience and community gathering.  Our house in Chorlton will be transformed into an art exhibition space and pop up cinema. In the moving image exhibition, work will focus on the different manifestations of moving image with a chance to create your own moving image pieces. The screening will feature work from several local artists and short film makers and be topped off with a live music set to finish. As with all Come Together events this is a chance to share the curated space with friends and neighbours and to experience and enjoy local art and culture together.  Each ticket includes a free drink and there will be drinks and cinema snacks for sale. So come along this February for an evening at the pictures with us at Come Together Collective x",
